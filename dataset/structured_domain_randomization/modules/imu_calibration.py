    """
    Introduce calibration-error-like noise to an input sequence of IMU data.

    Parameters:
     - C_imu: list of lists, shape (N, 6), where N is the number of time steps.
      Each inner list represents a set of IMU measurements for a specific time step, containing the following float values:
      [acceleration_X, acceleration_Y, acceleration_Z, rotation_rate_X, rotation_rate_Y, rotation_rate_Z]

    - p_occurrence: float, optional, probability of calibration error occurrence at each time step.
      Default is 0.1 (10% probability).

    - impact: float, optional, magnitude of the calibration error impact on each measurement.
      Default is 0.1.

    Returns:
    - result: list of lists, shape (N, 6), representing the input IMU data with added calibration-error-like noise.
